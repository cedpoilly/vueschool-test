# Updating the Dynamic Content

This document will guide you through updating the dynamic content for this page.

## Accessing the Sanity.io Interface

To access the interface, you will have to go to the link provided by the team. Replace `<theprovidedurl>` with the actual URL for your project.

1. Navigate to the link, which will either be a hosted link (e.g., https://ouraweseomesvueschoolhomepage.com) or the local development link (requiring the project to be running locally) http://localhost:3333.

2. Login via the method specified by the team: Google, GitHub, or email & password.

Voila, you now have access to the project's CMS interface! 🥳

## Updating the Hero Section

Let's update the content for the hero section.

1. Make sure you are on the route `/structure`.

2. On the left pane, under "Content", click on "Hero Section".

3. Click on the first (and only item) in the next column (it could be labeled "Talk to sales").

4. On the editor, edit the data as needed.

5. Once you are done, click the "Publish" button at the bottom right corner of the screen.

Congratulations! You have made your first update on the project.

**NB:** It can take a few seconds for the update to appear. So if you refresh quickly after publishing and do not yet see the update reflected, wait a few more seconds before reloading the page again.

## Updating the Stats Section

Updating the stats section follows the same process as for the hero section.

1. While on the `/structure` route, select "Stats Section" from "Content".

2. Under "Stats Section" select the one and only item, which should read something like "lessonCount: 763, coursesCount: 40" (the numbers could change).

3. Edit the numbers as necessary.

4. Once done, hit the "Publish" button.

Good job! You have updated the stats section! 👏

## Updating the Features for the Pricing List

The main difference with the previous sections is that here, we have three pricing items instead of one.

1. While still on the `/structure` route, select "Pricing Item " from "Content".

2. From the three (or more) items in the list, click on the one you want to edit.

**To update or add a feature:**

1.  Locate the pricing item you want to edit under "Content" > "Pricing Item".
2.  **To update an existing feature:**
    - Click the feature.
    - Edit the fields.
    - Click outside the modal.
3.  **To add a new feature:**
    _ Click "+ Add Item".
    _ Fill in the form. \* Click outside the modal.
4.  **Important:** Click the "Publish" button to save changes for both updating and adding features.

Well done! You should see your updated or new feature in the specified pricing item.

**If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the dev team!**
